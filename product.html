          <h3><em>New limbs out of Lego?</em></h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          In 2022, there was a man from Uganda, Bwan Bnal, who made his prostheses from Lego Technic. After he lost both his arms and legs from stumbling over a tree trunk, while attempting to sprint across the entire country, carrying his new set of lego.
          Despite the lack of the limbs, the mr. Bnal made his own artificial limbs, with the help of his family dog, and the funding from Wakaliwood. Now he can participate in the local contest, which involves running through the country, carrying the latest Lego sets for the local warlord.
          A very inspiring story indeed.

        <p>
          With the help of prostheses, people with physically disabilities, as a result from severe injuries, or genetic can finally be able to sport again. It also comes with the benefit of not being as restrictive as wheelchairs; people can stand up straight, and run as much as they like.
          People with prostheses can climb, jog, sprint, and grab. Ever wanted to play football, sprints, sportclimbing, or basketball, but couldn't because of disabilities? Fear no more because now you can.

          Most prostheses have 5 parts: The socket, where the limb is inserted in, the suspension, to keep it in place, the shaft, which is the main arm, or leg, and the last part is the hand, or feet. You can also get cosmetics on it. the Depending on the limb, prostheses will have different ways of using it, but you will also have to learn how to move with it.

          Meet Bwan Bnal, a 27 year old man, from Uganda, who had lost his limbs in 2022, but constructed his own prosthetic limbs with Lego.
          Micha McDiv: "So mr. Bnal, why did you construct your prostheses with Lego? Why didn&#39;t you go to the hospital?"
          Bwan Bnal: "Well, our local warlord didn't want to fund hospitals, and told us that the newest Lego set was more important than human lives."
          "When I stumbled over that tree truck, I thought that I could never sport again. But my family dog, and my friends over at Wakaliwood, ensured that I could still run and sport."

          Tree Stumbling Innovations, is a company based in Mexico, which specialises in custom prostheses for sport.
          They provide 3 types of custom prostheses: Standard limbs, Robotic limbs, and Myoelectric Limbs.
          They also build it with the material of choice: plastic, polymer, wood, etc.

          <h3><em>Just like an actual limb</em></h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          With the success of prosthetics in the sports community, the future is certainly bright. Also has there been successful experiments with brain-controlled prostheses.
          With brain-controlled prostheses, it would function exactly like a real limb; connected, and moving with the impulses of our brain.
          We could also design it to look like a real limb, and people wouldn't even notice. All of this in just the near future.
          Perhaps we can use them to enhance our current capabilities.
